# Fuzzy Logic - Classical Set Theory
---
## Purpose

A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. The elements of a set can be written as a list using curly braces. If the order of the elements is changed, or if any element of the set is repeated, nothing changes in the set.

 ## Mathematical Representation of a Set

Roster or Tabular Form
In this format, a set is written as a list of all its elements. The elements are enclosed in curly braces and separated by commas.

in Roster or Tabular Form:

Alphabet Set: A = {x,y,z,t,w,v,y}

Number Set: B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

---
## Set Constructor Notation

Set elements are defined by a common property. A is defined as A = {x:p(x)}.

Example: The set {1,3,5,7,9} is written as follows:

B = {x:1 ≤ x < 10 and (x%2) ≠ 0}
