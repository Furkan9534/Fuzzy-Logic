# Fuzzy Logic - Classical Set Theory

## Purpose

A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. The elements of a set can be written as a list using curly braces. If the order of the elements is changed, or if any element of the set is repeated, nothing changes in the set.

 ## Mathematical Representation of a Set

Roster or Tabular Form
In this format, a set is written as a list of all its elements. The elements are enclosed in curly braces and separated by commas.

in Roster or Tabular Form:

Alphabet Set: A = {x,y,z,t,w,v,y}

Number Set: B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
